# MD_water_crisis

Overview:

This project focuses on analyzing water data for the Maji Ndogo region to address its ongoing water crisis. The analysis involves multiple datasets related to water sources, water quality, well pollution, employee records, and visit logs. The goal is to uncover insights that can inform better management and improvement of water resources in the region.

Objectives:

Data Exploration: Investigate the various datasets to understand the structure and key attributes.
Water Source Analysis: Examine the types and distribution of water sources and evaluate their usage and service levels.
Queue Time Assessment: Analyze the time spent in queues at different water sources and identify patterns based on days of the week and hours of the day.
Water Quality Evaluation: Assess the quality of water sources and identify any discrepancies or pollution issues.
Employee Data Cleaning: Standardize employee information, including email addresses and phone numbers, and aggregate performance metrics.
Location Analysis: Understand the geographical distribution of water sources across towns and provinces.
Comparative Analysis: Compare subjective and objective water quality scores to verify consistency and accuracy in assessments.

Key Findings:

Water Source Distribution: The majority of water sources are taps and wells, with significant usage variability across different types.
Queue Times: Average queue times vary significantly by day and hour, with certain periods experiencing longer wait times.
Water Quality: Several water sources with high subjective quality scores still show biological contamination, indicating a need for better monitoring and reporting.
Pollution Issues: Instances of misreported clean results in the presence of biological contaminants were identified and corrected.
Employee Performance: Employee data was standardized, and performance metrics such as visit counts were aggregated to identify top-performing staff.
Geographical Insights: The analysis revealed disparities in the number of documented water sources across different towns and provinces, highlighting areas that may need more attention.
Verification Discrepancies: Comparative analysis between auditor and surveyor scores showed differences, suggesting the need for more consistent evaluation methods.
